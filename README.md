## Overview

TaskOrbit is a compact, production-minded project management system built as a recruitment task for [DataPollex Limited](https://www.datapollex.com). It supports two main panels:

- **Admin / Manager Dashboard** — create and manage projects, sprints, tasks, teams, and reports.
- **Member Panel** — consume assigned work, update task status, log time, and track personal and project progress.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB Atlas cluster (or local MongoDB 6+)
- Cloudinary account (free tier is sufficient)

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shalauddinahmedshipon/task-orbit-server.git
cd task-orbit-server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your values — see Environment Variables section below

# Run in development mode (ts-node-dev with hot reload)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
npm start
```

The server starts at `http://localhost:5000`. On first boot, the seed function creates an admin account using the credentials in your `.env` file.

### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shalauddinahmedshipon/task-orbit-client.git
cd task-orbit-client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env.local
# Set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL to your backend URL

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
npm start
```

The client starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Environment Variables

### Backend `.env`

```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000

# MongoDB Atlas connection string
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/<dbname>?appName=Cluster0

# JWT
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_here
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# Bcrypt
BCRYPT_SOLT=10

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Seed admin (created on first boot if no admin exists)
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@email.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=123456
```

### Frontend `.env.local`

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

> For production, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to your deployed backend URL, e.g. `https://task-orbit-server.vercel.com/api`.

---

## Authentication Flow

1. User submits email and password to `POST /api/auth/login`
2. Server validates credentials, generates a signed JWT, and sets it as an **HTTP-only cookie** (`accessToken`)
3. All subsequent requests automatically include the cookie — no manual token management on the frontend
4. The Redux `authSlice` stores the user object (name, email, role) returned from the login response
5. On app boot, `GET /api/auth/get-me` re-hydrates the auth state from the cookie
6. Logout calls `POST /api/auth/logout` which clears the cookie server-side

> Cookies are set with `httpOnly: true`, `secure: true` in production, and `sameSite: 'none'` to support cross-origin requests between Vercel (client) and Render (server).

## Role-Based Access Control

| Feature | Admin | Manager | Member |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Create / delete projects | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Create / delete sprints | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Create / edit / delete tasks | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Update task status | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (own tasks only) |
| Approve / reject review tasks | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Upload / delete attachments | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Add / edit / delete comments | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (own only) |
| Log / delete time entries | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (own only) |
| Manage team members | ✅ | ✅ (members only) | ❌ |
| Delete users | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View reports | ✅ | ✅ | Own only |
| View all projects | ✅ | ✅ | Assigned only |
| View all tasks | ✅ | ✅ | Assigned only |

Route guards are enforced both server-side (auth middleware checks JWT role) and client-side (Next.js layout guards redirect based on Redux `authSlice` role).
